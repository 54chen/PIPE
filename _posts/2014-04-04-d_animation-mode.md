#### Animation mode ![Animation mode](images/taskbar/animation_mode.png) 
You may toggle animation mode for a given Petri net by clicking on the animation mode button. This mode changes the tool bar along the top to contain useful tools for animation. It also displays the animation history on the left hand side of the screen.

#### Firing a transition ![Random fire](images/taskbar/random_transition.png) ![animate fire](images/taskbar/animate.png) 
Enabled transitions are highlighted in red in animation mode and there are three different ways to fire a transition:

1. Clicking on the transition you wish to fire.
2. Clicking on the random transition button (single lightening bolt). This randomly picks a transition based on priorities and type to fire.
3. Clicking on the multiple animate button. This will ask you how many transitions you wish to fire and the time between firing. It will then randomly select the transitions to animate.

#### Stepping backward/forward  ![Step backward](images/taskbar/backward.png) ![Step forward](images/taskbar/forward.png)
The backward and forward buttons are located next to the random firing buttons on the tool bar. Press these to step forward and backward through the animation history.
