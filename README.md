# PIPE 2 #

A tool for creating and analysing Petri nets, migrated from http://pipe2.sourceforge.net/about.html

## About ##
PIPE2 is an open source, platform independent tool for creating and analysing Petri nets including 
Generalised Stochastic Petri nets. Petri nets are a popular way for modelling concurrency and synchronisation 
in distributed systems. To learn more about Petri nets, you can start by reading the 2006/7 MSc. 
project report available [here](http://pipe2.sourceforge.net/docs.html).

PIPE2 began life in 2002/3 as an MSc. Group Project at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London called 
"The Platform Independent Petri net Editor PIPE". This is now the official branch of that project. 
It is still being maintained as an on-going project at the college.
